# Songs
Here are kept all songs (.wav format) and information about the songs database and the file keeping track of how many times is a song played.
Inside the songs.sg file are example songs for the program, but if you want to launch it, you have to replace **File location** with a valid location on your computer of the file containing the song. The integer in front of every song is its unique id.
